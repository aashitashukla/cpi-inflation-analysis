# CPI Inflation Analysis: India (2013â€“2020)

This project presents a data-driven analysis of Indiaâ€™s **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** from 2013 to 2020. The goal is to evaluate inflation trends across key consumption categories and understand how prices evolved over time, using tools from R and data science.

## Overview

Using publicly available government CPI data, the project performs:

- Data cleaning and month/year parsing
- Long-format data transformation for plotting
- Time series visualization of Food, Fuel, and Housing prices
- Calculation of monthly percent change in fuel
- Identification of the most volatile CPI categories

## Technologies Used

- R (v4.5+)
- tidyverse: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `lubridate`, `readr`
- R Markdown for reporting and PDF rendering

## Key Insights

- **Fuel and Light** prices were the most volatile, especially during the 2020 pandemic
- **Food and Beverages** followed a steady, seasonal pattern driven by agricultural cycles
- **Housing** remained relatively stable across years

## Data Source

This project uses official CPI data from the **Government of India** available on [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in).
